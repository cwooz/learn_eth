# Eth tut 1

# Intro for static_example

This is a demonstration of how ethereum can be used to run serverless dapps in the simplest form with the least amount of code, tooling or setup.  
In this example we'll be publishing a pre-written greeter contract which responds with the greeting phrase it is bootstrapped with. Then we'll attempt to call the greeting contracts greet function from our front-end js and render it.   

Quick learning assignment: Implement front-end js+html to change the greeting phrase in the greeter contract.

## Requirements:
  - Chrome browser + meta-mask plugin
  - Nodejs

## Setup:
Run:
`cd static_example`  
`npm install && npm start`  
Switch to the rinkeby testnet using metamask and go to the browser address and you should see "Data: Hello world from rinkeby!"

### For truffle local dev:
```
npm install -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc
```
Run testrpc server: `testrpc`  
Truffle commands:  
`truffle compile`
`truffle migrate`
